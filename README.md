# FOSS Project Evaluations

The repository will collect evaluations of FOSS projects with regard to their suitability for student engagement. The evaluations should be easy to update. The evaluation rubric may also change over time.

## Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation criteria to be initially used are obtained from the POSSE community's [Project Evaluation (Activity)](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Project_Evaluation_(Activity)).

## Keep in Touch

We have set up a group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/foss-project-evaluations which is open for all to join
