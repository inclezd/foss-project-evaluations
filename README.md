# FOSS Project Evaluations

The repository will collect evaluations of FOSS projects with regard to their suitability for student engagement. The evaluations should be easily updated over time. The evaluation rubric may also change over time.

## Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation criteria to be initially used are obtained from the POSSE community's [Project Evaluation (Activity)](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Project_Evaluation_(Activity)).
